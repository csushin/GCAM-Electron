This is a minimal Electron application based on the [Quick Start Guide](http://electron.atom.io/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start) within the Electron documentation.

**Use this app along with the [Electron API Demos](http://electron.atom.io/#get-started) app for API code examples to help you get started.**

A basic Electron application needs just these files:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.

You can learn more about each of these components within the [Quick Start Guide](http://electron.atom.io/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start).

Learn more about Electron and its API in the [documentation](http://electron.atom.io/docs/latest).

<!-- <<<<<<< HEAD -->
This app requires the python library Pandas(and its required libs such as numpy(>1.7.1)) and sklearn. So before you compile the app, you should first have the libs ready in python 3.4. <br/>
`python -m pip install pandas`<br/>
`python -m pip install sklearn`<br/>
`python -m pip install numpy`
